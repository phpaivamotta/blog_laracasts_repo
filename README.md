## About blog_laracasts_repo

This repo was initially created as I was following along with Laracasts' tutorial, Laravel 8 From Scratch (at www.laracasts.com).
After the series was done, I decided to keep working on the project. The project has now turned into a full-on website being operated by my partner, Jessica Szklarz, who already used the medium platform as a blog, but did not have an exclusive website yet. You can visit the website at https://www.polianaporcelana.com.
